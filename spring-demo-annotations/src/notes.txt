Bean Scopes
	- Scope refers to the lifecycle of a bean
	- how the bean is being created
	- how its being shared
	- how long does it live for
	
Default scope for all beans is Singleton.
	- It is cached in memory
	- Spring container only creates one instance of the bean, by default
	- All requests for the bean will return a SHARED instance to the SAME bean.
If you create two objects of the same class with different variable names, they will share the same reference in the spring 
object container.

Using annotations to specify the scope you would like your component to have. @Scope
Setting the scope to prototype, you will get a new object for each request when using context.getbean(object, class of object)

If you are using @Scope("prototype") then Spring will not call the Predestroy by default.
